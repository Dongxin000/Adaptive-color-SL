function d = distToEpipolarLine(F, p1, p2)
%% Given a fundamental matrix F, compute the matched point pair to their 
% corresponding epipolarlines' distances, then sum the two distances.
% Extracted from Matlab built-in function estimateFundamentalMatrix.m

% Very important: F must map a point p1 to an epipolar line in p2 image space, not the other way around.
